[Download the archive](https://github.com/Landish/laravel-ka/archive/master.zip) and place the `ka` folder into your `/resources/lang/` directory.\r\n2. Open `/config/app.php` file, replace `locale` key from `en` to `ka` and you're ready to go.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'locale' => 'ka',\r\n```\r\n*These translated files also exists in [caouecs/Laravel-lang](https://github.com/caouecs/Laravel-lang) repository, which can be installed with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).*\r\n\r\n## Validation Translation\r\n\r\nIf you want to translate form field names, during [validation](http://laravel.com/docs/validation), open the `/resources/lang/ka/validation.php` and at the end of the file set up the `attributes` array:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'attributes' => [\r\n\t'title' => 'სათაური'\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, if you have `required` rule on the `title` field and you'll leave blank during form submit, you'll get the validation error message `სათაური აუცილებელია` instead of `title აუცილებელია`.\r\n\r\n## Contribution & Bugs\r\n\r\nFeel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Landish/laravel-ka/issues/new) or pull request, if you find any bugs, have a question or an improved version of translaton. :thumbsup:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\n[The MIT License (MIT)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n",
